Progressive Sequence Alignment and UPGMA Tree

## Stage 1: Pairwise alignment
Conduct a global sequence alignment with affine gap penalties between two sequences stored in a single FASTA file.

-ask the user if nucleotide or protein sequences.
-if protein, use the PAM 100 matrix for match/mismatch scores.

### Output
Pairwise sequence alignment in a format easily read by a naive biologist.

## Stage 2: FORTHCOMING.
